Number Gussing game

use Random to import

Challenges:
Add Difficulty Levels:

Allow the user to choose a difficulty level (e.g., easy, medium, hard).
Adjust the number of attempts based on the difficulty:
Easy: 10 attempts
Medium: 7 attempts
Hard: 5 attempts

Track Best Score:
Keep track of the user's best score (fewest attempts to guess the number).
Display the best score at the end of each round.

Add a Timer:
Measure how long it takes the user to guess the number.
Display the time taken at the end of the game.

Input Validation:
Ensure the user enters a number within the valid range (e.g., 1 to 100).
Display an error message if the input is out of range.

Hints:
Provide hints after a certain number of failed attempts (e.g., "The number is even" or "The number is greater than 50").

Custom Range:
Allow the user to choose the range of numbers (e.g., 1 to 50, 1 to 200, etc.).

Multiplayer Mode:
Allow two players to take turns guessing the number.
The player who guesses the number in fewer attempts wins.

Score System:
Assign points based on the number of attempts:
Fewer attempts = higher score.

Display the score at the end of each round.

Visual Feedback:

Use ASCII art or emojis to provide visual feedback (e.g., ðŸŽ‰ for a win, ðŸ˜¢ for a loss).

Save Progress:

Save the user's best score or progress to a file.
Load the saved data when the game starts.
